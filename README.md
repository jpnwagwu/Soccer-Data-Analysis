# Soccer-Data-Analysis

Link to Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer

For this final project, I conducted my own data analysis and created a report that documents my findings. 

I started by taking a look at the dataset and brainstorming what questions one could answer using it. 

Then I used pandas and NumPy to answer the questions I was most interested in, and created a report sharing the answers. 

There was no inferential statistics or machine learning and my findings are tentative. 

Note that This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer.
